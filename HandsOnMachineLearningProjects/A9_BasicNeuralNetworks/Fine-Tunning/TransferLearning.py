# Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed
# for a specific task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.
# Essentially, you're transferring the learned features (or representations) to a new problem.
# This is particularly useful in deep learning where training neural networks
# from scratch can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.
